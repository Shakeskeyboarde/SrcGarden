# marked-math

Math extension for Marked.

This matches dollar sign (`$`) delimited math expression and renders them as `<code class="language-math">` blocks. This extension does not process the expression (eg. with MathJax). To render them as SVG or HTML, a second rendering step is required before the HTML is inserted into the DOM.
